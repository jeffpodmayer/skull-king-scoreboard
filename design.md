# Skull King Scoreboard Design Document

## Background

This project is a React-based application designed to ease score tracking for the card game Skull King, a trick-taking game where players bid on the number of tricks they expect to win in each round. The game introduces unique scoring rules that can sometimes be challenging to keep track of, especially when multiple players are involved.

The purpose of this application is to allow one player to act as the scorekeeper, easily adding players, recording their bids, calculating scores automatically based on game rules, and displaying the total points after each round. Also, the application supports bonuses for special actions like capturing a pirate or winning a round with the highest card.

The application allows players to record their bids, tricks won, and apply the necessary penalties or rewards, providing a real-time calculation of scores. The application supports adding any number of players, up to the maximum allowed by the game, and features an optional history component for reviewing previous game rounds.

## Context

The Skull King scoring application is designed for players of the card game Skull King who want a more streamlined and automated way to keep track of scores. Typically, during a Skull King game, one player is responsible for manually calculating the score for each round based on the bids and tricks won by all participants. Given the complexity of Skull King's scoring system—where correct bids earn points, incorrect bids incur penalties, and bonuses apply for special achievements—keeping track of everything can quickly become cumbersome, especially in longer games with more players.
